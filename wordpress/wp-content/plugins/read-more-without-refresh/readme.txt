Let your visitors expand hidden content (100% readable by Search Engines) without refreshing the page & auto-boost your SEO!

== Description ==

<p>So you want to show more content but not affect users experience?</p>
<p><strong>I got you covered</strong>! </p>
<p>My plugin hides the predefined text, through a shortcode and based on your choice, leaving the remaining one visible to the search engines. </p>
<p>Your readers will be also able to read more content by pressing the 'Read More' button, without having the page reloaded.</p>
<p>Once you press <strong>"Read more" button</strong>, it will <strong>expand</strong>.
They will also be able to hide it again by pressing the same button, which would have been converted to <strong>'Read less'</strong>.</p>
<p>It works via a shortcode and can be placed everywhere!</p>
<p>You can change its colors through its settings menu!</p>
<p>Simple usage: <strong>[read more] Your long text [/read]</strong></p>
