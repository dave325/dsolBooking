<p>   <a href="https://www.theknightnews.com/2019/03/26/qc-tech-incubator-hosts-first-ai-search-engine/"> QC Tech Incubator hosts first AI-search engine | The Knight News         </a>   ­                                         </p>



<p>Queens College’s Tech Incubator is the mini-Shark-Tank in Queens, a place for great minds to create projects and bring technological change. <br></p>



<p>The QC Tech Incubator established itself as a resource for innovative thinkers, creators, and technologists since its foundation in 2016. The Incubator has become a hub for scientific experiments, technological tinkerings, and above all, a space for geniuses to pool their knowledge and work together. On Jan. 25th, 2019, the QC Tech Incubator had reached yet another moment in the national spotlight. <br></p>



<p>NewtonX, known as “…an artificial intelligence-powered knowledge search engine that matches clients to the world’s leading investors, consultants, and technology experts…”, first found its way to the Incubator through both parties’ mutual associate: Sascha Eder. Both a co-founder of NewtonX and a member of the Incubator, it was Eder who obtained the company’s access to the resources the Incubator offers. <br></p>



<p>As Director and Chief Financial Officer of NewtonX, Eder found his way to Queens College through an international-entrepreneur program called “IN2NYC”. According to the company’s online-blog, NewtonX is the world’s “…first AI-powered knowledge marketplace”, geared towards clients of an extensive variety, ranging from banking to consulting and technology. <br></p>



<p>“Our main product is a service by which we leverage our proprietary knowledge graph to connect clients from all industries,” Eder said. “[It provides] experts they need to speak to in order to get insights for critical business decisions they otherwise couldn’t obtain”.<br></p>



<p>As reported by a press release on Queens College’s website, IN2NYC was inaugurated in 2016 by the New York City Economic Development Corporation as a partnership between the NYCEDC and CUNY schools. Tech:nyc says the purpose of this organization is to provide foreign entrepreneurs the exemption to H-1B visas. <br></p>



<p>According to Workpermit, “The US H-1B visa is a non-immigrant which visa allows US companies to employ graduate level workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialized fields such as in IT, finance, accounting, architecture, engineering, mathematics, science, medicine, etc.” A professional must have at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalency) in order to be eligible. <br></p>



<p>The name ‘NewtonX’ stems from the legacy of Isaac Newton, who once said “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” The ‘X’ is what introduces the technological background; it symbolizes the “edge” the technology brings forth. <br></p>



<p>For those inspired by Eder and his company’s accomplishments, TIQC is the first step to take in the direction of building a startup. As listed on the QC website, “Harnessing the advanced computational infrastructure and intellectual resources of Queens College of the City University of New York, TIQC creates an outstanding co-working environment for tech startups.” For students and faculty, there are individual and shared work-spaces available 24/7 with a keycard. <br></p>



<p>Cardholders may work on projects with team members, or utilize the expertise of the faculty and industry leaders. <br></p>



<p>In addition to its partnership with successful NewtonX, the Tech Incubator also produced ‘Kidmoto’ back in 2016. An Uber-like car service to connect passengers with drivers equipped with federally-approved car seats, Kidmoto began laying its foundation at the TIQC. Nelson Nigel, the founder and CEO of the company, was, at the time, one of about 10 startups that originated within QC, says NY1. In an interview Nigel expressed his hope for a more “kid-friendly” car service. <br></p>



<p>The Tech Incubator at Queens College is located at 65-30 Kissena Blvd. CEP Hall 2. </p>

As a member of the incubator, Eder has access to college facilities and to QC’s biggest asset—its people. “Queens College students and faculty are a great resource for us,” he says, “whether it’s talent in software engineering or a business professor’s expertise.” In turn, he has involved himself deeply in campus and community life.The mutually beneficial relationship between Queens College and Eder, a German native, results from the&nbsp;<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001bgbqtGOAK-Qxv3pHsvfy6eR4FEKiwTOhLj_AsJgTSvztrE2OHqBDvr9JGcEjeaUby-oUP2_JNWmdKtUF4SxvlBrbu59pFeuJgLRHRBNuxIPN_IZkfgehVrYRBR1YoFl4b931DgNxcw0=&amp;c=u_Vyf_DOxTFkmgUpuaGr-H3uFZOO81fcgTM3OJwQf9TOrT0pIKdv4g==&amp;ch=6yzWnQr9-u87K8eOlEx0ddl5NmoAgM5keNM3Tontc19xuV0KYgI8Kg==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Innovators Initiative (IN2NYC)</a>.&nbsp;Inaugurated in 2016 by the New York City Economic Development Corporation in collaboration with several CUNY colleges, IN2NYC is designed to attract foreign-born entrepreneurs to our city. Applicants who meet the qualifications receive the coveted cap-exempt H-1B visa to work in the United States while building their businesses in tech incubators at participating CUNY campuses and New York University. Additionally, IN2NYC participants serve as mentors to students, create internships and job opportunities, and contribute to academic research and curricula. “When we established our tech incubator in 2016, we had in mind a rich partnership between tech-focused entrepreneurs, our students, faculty, and staff and the borough,” says Queens College President Félix V. Matos Rodríguez. “Having Sascha with us thanks to IN2NYC is exactly the kind of knowledge-sharing collaboration we anticipated.” After undergraduate studies at the University of Mannheim and the University Carlos III of Madrid, Eder earned a master’s degree at the HEC School of Management in Paris. At 23, he moved to the United States to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, completing his second master’s degree, in entrepreneurship and technological innovation.At QC, Eder launched a lecture series in which he discusses artificial intelligence and other technology subjects. These no-cost, one-hour events are open to students and the larger community. Eder also held a full-day weekend workshop focusing on the steps needed to succeed as an entrepreneur.

Where are they working geographically? What’s the correlation with their major?”For Media Studies Professor Douglas Rushkoff’s Tech Development Lab class, Eder gave a talk, provided feedback on the students’ work, and was a judge for their final presentations. In December, he joined the jury for the Tech Incubator’s first “Pitch Fest,” a competition awarding cash prizes to budding entrepreneurs who propose the best ideas for tech-enabled products or services. “I’m excited to be here,” says Eder. “I enjoy mentoring and teaching students and helping them to become the next generation of entrepreneurs,” he says. “They will come up with the ideas that will at some point change the way we do things.”</td></tr></tbody></table>
